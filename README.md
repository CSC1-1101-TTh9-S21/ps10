As always, you will submit to Canvas **a single .zip file**. Detailed instructions for what the .zip file should contain are at the end of this problem set. 

Download this whole directory to your desktop, unzip it, and carry out the tasks described below.

## Part 1: Using a Jupyter notebook

To use a Jupyter notebook, you need to install the `juypter` library. To do, just follow [the directions in PS7 for installing libraries](https://github.com/CSC1-1101-TTh9-S21/ps7#step-1-install-the-libraries). In other words, launch a Terminal (Mac) or command (Windows) and type:

`pip3 install jupyter`

Be sure to check the alternative things to type in [the previous instructions for installing libraries](https://github.com/CSC1-1101-TTh9-S21/ps7#step-1-install-the-libraries) in case you have an unusual configuration.
